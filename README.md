# SDR_ieee802.15.4_PHY
Software Defined Radio (SDR) used to implement the IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer (PHY)
(This is just the beginning and only the receiver has been implemented so far)

The project was created using the Qt5 framework.

Tested configurations:
OS: Linux Mint 20 Ulyana 64-bit.
Processor: Intel© Core™ i5-8600 CPU @ 3.10GHz × 6

Supported devices:
1. PlutoSDR
2. LimeSDR mini 1.0
3. ...

Received signal parameters:
1. O-QPSK (IEEE 802.15.4 - 2003)
2. MAC syblayer :
 - frame control
 - addressing
 - frame check sequence
3. Capture and show raw frame
4. UDP ZEPv2. Support of other Ethernet based hardware to analyze 802.15.4 (https://wiki.wireshark.org/IEEE_802.15.4)
